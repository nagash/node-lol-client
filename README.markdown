===============

Forked from https://github.com/nagash/node-lol-client , credits for his work on most of the base code, and especially the namf module used to decode/encode the objects.

This fork aims to fix the bugs left behind in the original project, and expand the features for developmental purposes.

Currently works with version: '3.8.13_06_12_20_25' (As of 7/2/13)

View example.js to get an understanding of how the client works.
